#summary Just a list of what all needs to be completed.


= Things to do =

Create a virtual CPU

Create a memory manager

Create simulated registers

Create a program/data simulated RAM called memory

Create a simulated hard drive called disk

Ancillary programs to dispatch processes/programs from disk to RAM, to compute effective addresses, to access memory, to fetch instructions and decode instructions will also be needed. Additional support programs for conversions between hex, decimal, and binary numbers will be necessary.


*Java classes needed:*

Driver 

Loader

Scheduler

Memory

Dispatcher

DMA-Channel

Java methods needed:*

Effective Address

Fetch, Decode, Execute
