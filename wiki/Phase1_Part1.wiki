= Phase 1 - Part 1 =


*In Part 1, the following tasks are to be performed:*

  #.Decompose the project into 3 subtasks: 
    #) The Driver/Loader/Long-term sch subtasks, 
    #) The Short-term/Dispatcher/Context-Switcher subtask and 
    #) the CPU and associated modules. (Then define all the interfaces and data structures to be shared by all the 3 major components, and integrate them into your simulator). 
  #.Download the set of tasks/programs (in the program-data-file) to be executed from the course website. 
  #.Design and write the code for the short-term loader (you may take advantage of the loader-module in the given code).
  #.Add a program cache in the CPU module and compile it. And when the scheduler assigns a process to the CPU, the whole process must be loaded into the program cache of the CPU from the RAM. Run this single CPU as a single thread (a uniprocessor system).
  #.Execute the set of given processes (30) and measure the following.  
    *.Average waiting and completion time for each process
    *.Number of I/O each process made
    *.Average RAM and cache used
